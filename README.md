# Welcome to WP Geeks Boiler Theme ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ”­

My thoughts process of creating this boiler theme template are:
- How can you integrate WordPress with modern workflow as native as possible?
- How i can integrate WordPress with a modern css framework without having any hassle and activate their true potential ?
- How I can make a really good developer experience for myself and start coding without having to refresh your browser everytime
- Have anyone made this before? How I can made it even better?

Here is that I think something that can be a perfect theme. Wordpress theme settings that can work with WordPress natively and you can create a theme or a website only with advanced custom field.

I find a really good blog that explain and I improved the gulpfile and make it also integrate with terser and browsersync.
